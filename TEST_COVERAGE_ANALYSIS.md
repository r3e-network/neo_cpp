**Total Passing: 396 tests**

### ⚠️ Tests with Issues

| Test Suite | Tests | Status | Issues |
|------------|-------|--------|--------|
| Smart Contracts | 33/41 | 8 failures | Application engine API mismatches |

### ❌ Test Suites Not Building

| Area | Status | Reason | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| Consensus | Build errors | API incompatibilities, missing types | High - core protocol |
| RPC Server | Build errors | JSON API mismatches | High - node interface |
| P2P Network | Build errors | Missing implementations | High - node communication |
| Native Contracts | Partial | Missing NEO/GAS token tests | High - system contracts |
| Wallet Operations | Limited | Basic tests only | Medium - user functionality |

## Missing Test Areas (Compared to C# Neo)

### Critical Missing Areas

1. **Complete VM Opcode Coverage**
   - Current: 11/150+ opcodes tested
   - Missing: All opcode categories (arrays, control, bitwise, etc.)
   - Impact: Core VM execution validation

2. **Native Contract Tests**
   - Current: Basic tests only  
   - Missing: NEO token governance, GAS distribution, Policy contracts
   - Impact: System-level functionality

3. **Consensus Protocol Tests**
   - Current: 0 working tests
   - Missing: dBFT consensus, view changes, recovery
   - Impact: Network consensus validation

4. **Network Protocol Tests**
   - Current: 0 working tests
   - Missing: P2P messaging, peer discovery, block sync
   - Impact: Node networking

5. **Transaction Validation Tests**
   - Current: Basic tests only
   - Missing: Complex validation rules, fee calculation
   - Impact: Transaction processing

6. **Smart Contract Integration Tests**
   - Current: Unit tests only
   - Missing: Contract deployment, invocation, system calls
   - Impact: Contract execution

## Detailed Breakdown

### VM Tests (Currently 104 total)

- ✅ EC Recovery: 6 tests
- ⚠️ BLS12-381: 6 tests skipped (not fully implemented)
- ❌ Missing: secp256r1 comprehensive tests

### Smart Contract Tests (Currently 41 total, 8 failing)
- ✅ Contract State: 3 tests
- ✅ Contract Parameters: 3 tests
- ✅ NEF Files: Tests present
- ❌ Application Engine: API mismatches causing failures
- ❌ System Calls: Missing comprehensive coverage

## Recommendations to Reach 1000+ Tests

### Phase 1: Fix Existing Issues (Target: +50 tests)
1. Fix smart contract test failures
2. Enable BLS12-381 tests
3. Fix consensus test compilation

### Phase 2: Core VM Coverage (Target: +200 tests)
1. Implement all opcode tests (arithmetic, arrays, control, bitwise, etc.)
2. Add comprehensive script builder tests
3. Add VM integration tests

### Phase 3: Protocol Tests (Target: +150 tests)
1. Fix and enable network tests
2. Add consensus protocol tests
3. Add P2P messaging tests

### Phase 4: Native Contracts (Target: +100 tests)
1. NEO token tests (governance, voting)
2. GAS token tests (distribution, fees)
3. Policy contract tests
4. Oracle contract tests
5. Role management tests

### Phase 5: Integration Tests (Target: +200 tests)
1. Full node integration tests
2. Blockchain synchronization tests
3. Transaction pool tests
4. Block validation tests
5. End-to-end workflow tests

### Phase 6: Additional Coverage (Target: +200 tests)
1. RPC API comprehensive tests
2. Wallet functionality tests
3. Plugin system tests
4. Performance and stress tests
5. Security and edge case tests

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Enable disabled test suites** - Many test files exist but are commented out in CMakeLists.txt
2. **Fix API incompatibilities** - Update tests to match current C++ API
3. **Add missing implementations** - Some tests fail due to missing C++ implementations
4. **Create test data** - Many tests need JSON test vectors like the C# version

## Current Coverage Gaps

The C++ version has significant gaps in:
- **Opcode testing**: 11 vs 150+ opcodes
- **Network protocol testing**: 0 working tests
- **Consensus testing**: 0 working tests  
- **Native contract testing**: Minimal coverage
- **Integration testing**: Very limited

**Priority**: Focus on VM opcodes and native contracts first, as these are core to blockchain functionality.
