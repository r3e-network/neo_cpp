## Deployment Recommendations

### Required for Production
1. **Use Release Build**: `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
2. **Disable Debug Logs**: Compile with `-DNDEBUG`
3. **Enable All Optimizations**: Use `-O3` flag
4. **Configure Resource Limits**: Set appropriate limits in config
5. **Enable Monitoring**: Use provided metrics endpoints
