## Build Compilation Analysis

### Potential Compilation Issues

Based on the source code analysis, several areas may require attention during compilation:

**1. Missing Include Headers**
Some newer header files may not be properly included:
```cpp
// May need verification:
#include <neo/ledger/witness_scope.h>
#include <neo/smartcontract/contract_state.h>
#include <neo/network/p2p/payloads/neo3_transaction.h>
```

**2. Template Instantiation**
Some template-heavy components may require explicit instantiation:
- VM stack item types
- Storage key templates
- Cryptographic operations

**3. Platform-Specific Code**
Platform-specific implementations may need conditional compilation:
- Windows-specific networking code
- Linux-specific storage optimizations

### Required vcpkg Packages

The build requires the following vcpkg packages to be installed:
```bash
vcpkg install boost openssl nlohmann-json spdlog rocksdb gtest httplib
```

### Build Commands

**Standard Build Process:**
```bash
# Configure with vcpkg
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

# Build Release version
cmake --build build --config Release

# Run tests
cd build && ctest
```
