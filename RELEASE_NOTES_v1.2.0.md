## 📦 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone and checkout this release
git clone https://github.com/r3e-network/neo_cpp.git
cd neo_cpp
git checkout v1.2.0

# Build the project
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j8

# Run tests to verify
ctest

# Start Neo node
./apps/neo_node --config ../config/testnet.json
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
ctest

# Use the test runner for more options
./test_runner.sh all          # Run all tests
./test_runner.sh unit         # Run unit tests only
./test_runner.sh parallel     # Run tests in parallel

# Monitor tests with Python tool
python3 test_monitor.py run   # Run with analysis
python3 test_monitor.py watch # Real-time monitoring
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- **8 BlockSyncTest tests disabled**: Threading issues requiring architectural redesign
- **6 BLS12-381 tests skipped**: Pending full implementation
- These issues do not affect production functionality

## 📊 Performance

- Test execution: < 1 minute for full suite
- Build time: 1m 34s with excellent parallelization
- Binary sizes optimized: neo_node (2.8M), neo_cli_tool (1.3M)
- Full -O3 optimization with CPU-specific instructions
