# Neo C++ Quality Check Scripts

This directory contains comprehensive quality checking scripts for the Neo C++ implementation. These scripts help ensure code quality, completeness, and consistency with the C# reference implementation.

## Available Scripts

### 1. `check_all_quality.sh` (Master Script)
The main script that runs all quality checks and generates a comprehensive report.

```bash
./scripts/check_all_quality.sh
```

This script runs:
- Basic code quality checks
- C# consistency verification
- Compilation warning detection
- Code formatting checks
- Dependency analysis
- Security scanning
- Documentation coverage analysis

Results are saved to `quality_check_results/` directory with timestamps.

### 2. `check_code_quality.sh`
Checks for various code quality issues including:
- TODO/FIXME markers
- Placeholder implementations
- Simplified implementations
- Incomplete error handling
- Hardcoded values
- Debug code
- Large functions

```bash
./scripts/check_code_quality.sh
```

Exit codes:
- 0: No issues or only warnings
- 1: Critical issues found

### 3. `check_consistency_with_csharp.py`
Python script that verifies consistency between C++ implementation and C# Neo reference.

```bash
python3 ./scripts/check_consistency_with_csharp.py
```

Checks:
- Project structure alignment
- Native contract implementations
- Required method implementations
- Cryptography algorithm completeness
- Consensus mechanism implementation
- VM implementation completeness
- Common C# patterns and their C++ equivalents

### 4. `find_incomplete_implementations.py`
Specialized script to find incomplete or stub implementations.

```bash
# Basic usage
python3 ./scripts/find_incomplete_implementations.py

# Output in JSON format
python3 ./scripts/find_incomplete_implementations.py --json

# Show priority fixes
python3 ./scripts/find_incomplete_implementations.py --priority

# Specify custom path
python3 ./scripts/find_incomplete_implementations.py --path /path/to/neo_cpp
```

Detects:
- Not implemented exceptions
- Empty function implementations
- Placeholder/stub/dummy implementations
- Partial implementations
- TODO/FIXME comments
- Hardcoded temporary values

## Patterns Detected

### Critical Issues
- `throw "not implemented"`
- `placeholder` implementations
- Empty catch blocks
- Stub implementations
- Simplified cryptographic operations

### Warnings
- TODO/FIXME markers
- Temporary solutions marked with "for now"
- Magic numbers
- Debug output in production code
- Missing documentation

### Code Smells
- Large functions (>200 lines)
- Generic exception handling
- Assertions in production code
- Hardcoded values
- Ignored errors

## Output Format

### Console Output
All scripts provide colored console output:
- ðŸ”´ RED: Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW: Warnings that should be reviewed
- ðŸŸ¢ GREEN: Passed checks
- ðŸ”µ BLUE: Informational messages

### File Reports
Results are saved to `quality_check_results/` with timestamps:
- `summary_TIMESTAMP.txt`: Overall summary
- `basic_quality_TIMESTAMP.log`: Code quality check details
- `csharp_consistency_TIMESTAMP.log`: C# consistency check details
- `compilation_warnings_TIMESTAMP.log`: Build warnings
- `dependency_analysis_TIMESTAMP.log`: Include dependency analysis

## Integration with CI/CD

These scripts can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Quality Checks
  run: |
    ./scripts/check_all_quality.sh
  continue-on-error: false
```

```bash
# Example pre-commit hook
#!/bin/bash
./scripts/check_code_quality.sh || {
    echo "Quality check failed. Please fix issues before committing."
    exit 1
}
```

## Customization

### Adding New Patterns
Edit the pattern arrays in the scripts to add new checks:

```bash
# In check_code_quality.sh
check_pattern "new_pattern" "description" "severity" "exclude_dirs"
```

```python
# In find_incomplete_implementations.py
self.incomplete_patterns['new_category'] = [
    r'pattern1',
    r'pattern2',
]
```

### Excluding Directories
Most scripts exclude test directories by default. To modify:

```bash
# In shell scripts
local exclude_dirs="build,tests,test,third_party"

# In Python scripts
exclude_dirs = ['build', 'tests', 'test', '.git', 'third_party']
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run regularly**: Run these checks before major commits or releases
2. **Fix critical issues first**: Address red/critical issues before warnings
3. **Document exceptions**: If certain warnings are intentional, document why
4. **Update patterns**: Add new patterns as you discover new anti-patterns
5. **Automate**: Integrate into CI/CD for continuous quality monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh scripts/*.py
```

### Python Module Not Found
The Python scripts use only standard library modules. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed.

### Script Not Finding Files
Run scripts from the Neo C++ project root directory.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for these scripts:
- Integration with static analysis tools (clang-tidy, cppcheck)
- Performance profiling integration
- Test coverage analysis
- Automated fix suggestions
- Historical trend tracking
- Custom rule configuration files
