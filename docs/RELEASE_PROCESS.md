### 2. Version Bump

Use the version bump script:

```bash
# For patch release (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1)
./scripts/bump-version.sh patch

# For minor release (0.1.0 -> 0.2.0)
./scripts/bump-version.sh minor

# For major release (0.1.0 -> 1.0.0)
./scripts/bump-version.sh major

# For specific version
./scripts/bump-version.sh 1.2.3
```

### 3. Create Release

#### Automatic Release (Recommended)

1. **Push the tag to trigger workflow:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/bump-version.sh minor --push
   ```

2. **Monitor GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to Actions tab on GitHub
   - Watch "Release" workflow progress
   - Verify all build jobs succeed

3. **Review draft release:**
   - Go to Releases page
   - Review auto-generated release notes
   - Edit and enhance as needed

#### Manual Release

1. **Create and push tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

2. **Trigger workflow manually:**
   - Go to Actions â†’ Release workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Enter version number

### 4. Release Artifacts

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

#### Linux Build Issues

#### Windows Build Issues
- Check MSVC version
- Verify vcpkg packages
- Review PATH configuration

### Workflow Issues

#### Authentication Errors
- Verify GITHUB_TOKEN permissions
- Check repository settings
- Review workflow permissions

#### Upload Failures

## Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Release
1. Delete the release on GitHub
2. Delete the tag:
   ```bash
   git push --delete origin v0.1.0
   git tag -d v0.1.0
   ```
3. Fix issues
4. Create new release

### Hotfix Process
1. Create hotfix branch from tag
2. Apply fix and test
3. Bump patch version
4. Create new release
5. Merge fix to main branch

## Automation Scripts

### Version Management
```bash
# Show current version
cat VERSION

# Bump with dry run
./scripts/bump-version.sh patch --dry-run

# Bump and push
./scripts/bump-version.sh minor --push
```

### Local Testing
```bash
# Build release binary locally
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --parallel

# Test the binary
./build/apps/neo_node --version
```

### Release Validation
```bash
# Download and verify release
wget https://github.com/{owner}/neo-cpp/releases/download/v0.1.0/neo-node-linux-x64.tar.gz
wget https://github.com/{owner}/neo-cpp/releases/download/v0.1.0/neo-node-linux-x64.tar.gz.sha256

# Verify checksum
sha256sum -c neo-node-linux-x64.tar.gz.sha256

# Extract and test
tar -xzf neo-node-linux-x64.tar.gz
cd neo-node-linux-x64
./bin/neo-node --version
```

## Security Considerations

### Code Signing
- Sign binaries on macOS/Windows (when certificates available)
- Provide GPG signatures for Linux packages
- Include checksums for all artifacts

### Vulnerability Scanning
- Run security scans before release
- Check dependencies for CVEs
- Review security advisories

### Access Control
- Limit release permissions
- Use protected branches
- Require PR reviews

## Support

1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Review this documentation
3. Contact the development team
4. File an issue on GitHub
