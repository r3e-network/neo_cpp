## Release Notes

### v1.0.0 - Production Ready Release

This release marks the completion of the Neo C++ blockchain node implementation. The codebase has undergone comprehensive testing and validation, ensuring:

- **Complete Functionality**: All essential Neo N3 features implemented
- **Production Quality**: Enterprise-grade code with comprehensive error handling
- **Performance Optimized**: High-throughput, low-latency implementation
- **Network Verified**: Successfully tested on Neo N3 MainNet
