|-------------|--------|-----------|
| All criteria met | Proceed to next phase | Team Lead |
| Minor issues (<3 medium) | Proceed with plan | Project Manager |
| Major issues (1+ high) | Remediate and retest | Project Manager |
| Critical issues | Stop and escalate | Executive Sponsor |

### Escalation Path
1. **Level 1**: Team Lead - Operational decisions
2. **Level 2**: Project Manager - Phase decisions
3. **Level 3**: Director - Resource/timeline decisions
4. **Level 4**: Executive - Strategic decisions
